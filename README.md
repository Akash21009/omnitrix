The UI provides a modern and clean layout, ensuring a seamless user experience. Tasks are displayed in an organized manner, categorized based on their status (pending/completed/expired). User can put tasks in a particular tag/folder of it’s respective category which will help him keep track of multiple tasks. Each new tag/folder will randomly assigned a custom loadbar which will represent how many tasks in that tag/folder are completed. A notification panel will notify today’s deadlines and also when any deadline expired. A quick reminder panel will randomly show pending tasks in every five seconds. There’s also a quote panel which will show a new quote(entered by user in database) every day where each quote will assigned a random graphic image.

By clicking on “new tag” user can add a new tag for new category of tasks.

### Custom Animations

The UI comes alive with custom animations, enhancing user engagement and creating an aesthetically pleasing experience. Animations are thoughtfully integrated into user interactions with UI elements.
